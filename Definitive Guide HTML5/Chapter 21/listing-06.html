                There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500 varieties
                of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of apples,
                oranges, and other well-known fruit, we are faced with thousands
                of choices.

                One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the variety available in
                each country. I live near London, in an area which is known for
                its apples.

                When travelling in Asia, I was struck by how many different kinds of
                banana were available - many of which had unique flavours and which
                were only avaiable within a small region.
