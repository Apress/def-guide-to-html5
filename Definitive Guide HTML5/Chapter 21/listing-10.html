                    There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500
                    varieties of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of
                    apples, oranges, and other well-known fruit, we are faced with
                    thousands of choices.

                    One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the variety available
                    in each country. I live near London, in an area which is known for
                    its apples.

                    When travelling in Asia, I was struck by how many different kinds of
                    banana were available - many of which had unique flavours and which
                    were only avaiable within a small region.
