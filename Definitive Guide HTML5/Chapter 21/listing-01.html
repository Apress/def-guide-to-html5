            There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500 varieties
            of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of apples, oranges,
            and other well-known fruit, we are faced with thousands of choices.

            One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the variety available in
            each country. I live near London, in an area which is known for
            its apples.

            When travelling in Asia, I was struck by how many different
            kinds of banana were available - many of which had unique flavours and
            which were only avaiable within a small region.
