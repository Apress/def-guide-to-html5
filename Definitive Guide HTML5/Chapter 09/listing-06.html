        <p>I like apples and oranges.
        
        I also like bananas, mangoes, cherries, apricots, plums, peaches and grapes.
        You can see other fruits I like <a href="fruitlist.html">here</a>.</p>
    
        <p>My favorite kind of orange is the mandarin, properly known
            as <i>citrus reticulata</i>.
        Oranges at my local store cost <s>$1 each</s> $2 for 3.</p>

        <blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">
        The apple forms a tree that is small and deciduous, reaching 3 to 12 metres
        (9.8 to 39 ft) tall, with a broad, often densely twiggy crown.
        <hr>
        The leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals 5 to 12 cm long and 3–6
        centimetres (1.2–2.4 in) broad on a 2 to 5 centimetres (0.79 to 2.0 in) petiole
        with anacute tip, serrated margin and a slightly downy underside. Blossoms are
        produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves.
        <hr>
        The flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled,
        and 2.5 to 3.5 centimetres (0.98 to 1.4 in) in diameter.
        The fruit matures in autumn, and is typically 5 to 9 centimetres (
        2.0 to 3.5 in) in diameter.
        <hr>
        The center of the fruit contains five carpels arranged in a five-point star,
        each carpel containing one to three seeds, called pips.</blockquote>

        <p>I still remember the best apple I ever tasted.
        I bought it at <time datetime="15:00">3 o'clock</time>
            on <time datetime="1984-12-7">December 7th</time>. </p>
