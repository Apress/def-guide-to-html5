        I like apples and oranges.

        I also like bananas, mangoes, cherries, apricots, plums, peaches and grapes.
        You can see other fruits I like <a href="fruitlist.html">here</a>.
        
        <strong>Warning:</strong> Eating too many oranges can give you heart burn.
        
        My favorite kind of orange is the mandarin, properly known 
            as <i>citrus reticulata</i>.
        Oranges at my local store cost <s>$1 each</s> $2 for 3.        
            
        The <abbr title="Florida Department of Citrus">FDOC</abbr> regulates the Florida
            citrus industry.
            
        I still remember the best apple I ever tasted.
        I bought it at <time datetime="15:00">3 o'clock</time>
            on <time datetime="1984-12-7">December 7th</time>.
