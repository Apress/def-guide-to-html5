            There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500 varieties
            of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of apples, oranges,
            and other well-known fruit, we are faced with thousands of choices.

            One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the variety available in
            each country. I live near London, in an area which is known for
            its apples.

            When traveling in Asia, I was struck by how many different
            kinds of banana were available - many of which had unique flavors and
            which were only available within a small region.

            And, of course, there are fruits which are truly unique - I am put in mind
            of the durian, which is widely consumed in SE Asia and is known as the
            "king of fruits." The durian is largely unknown in Europe and the USA - if
            it is known at all, it is for the overwhelming smell, which is compared
            to a combination of almonds, rotten onions and gym socks.
