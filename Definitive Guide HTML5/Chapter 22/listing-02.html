            There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500
            varieties
            
            of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of
            apples, oranges, and other well-known fruit, we are faced with
            thousands of choices.
            
            One     of the      most interesting aspects of fruit is the
            variety available   in each country. I live near London,
            
            in an area which is
            known for its apples.
