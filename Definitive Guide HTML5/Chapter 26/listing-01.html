            There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500
            varieties of <span id="banana">banana</span> alone. By the time we add the
            countless types of apples, oranges, and other well-known fruit, we are faced
            with thousands of choices.

        <p id="apples">
            One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the
            variety available in each country. I live near London, in an area which is
            known for its apples.
